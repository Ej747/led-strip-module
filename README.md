# led-strip-module
Somewhat a wip. The code works as intended but needs some refining and polishing, it's far from efficient.

Not exactly necessary to make a github page for this ~~as it's a single python file~~, but I figured it would be easier to keep track of changes.

Powered by a Raspbery Pi Pico running micropython, this controls a strip of ws2812b eco leds.

I'm going to design a case in onshape to be 3d printed. Will make public and put link here when done
